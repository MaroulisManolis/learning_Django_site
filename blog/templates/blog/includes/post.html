                <h3>Mountain Hiking</h3>
                <p>There's nothing like the views you get 
                    when hiking in the mountains of Naxos! 
                    Just imagine a clear sky, the Aegean Sea 
                    and many of the smaller islands floating 
                    in the sea around you!
